# DevClub Summer of Code 2023

## App Development: Week 1 

This assignment will allow you to apply your Flutter skills.

1. **Marketplace Design Exploration** We encourage you to explore various marketplace designs available in the industry. While we provide our own design guidelines, we want you to research and gather inspiration from existing e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, and others. Analyze their layouts, navigation patterns, product displays, and user experience. Based on your analysis, create sketches outlining the design of our marketplace app.

2. **Product Listing Implementation** Implement a basic product listing functionality in your Flutter app. Create a list of dummy products with details such as title, description, price, and image. You can hard-code the product data. Display the product listings using Flutter widgets like ListView or GridView. Focus on creating an appealing and user-friendly interface that allows users to browse through the available products.

3. **Product Details and Interaction** Extend your app to display detailed product information when a user selects a product from the listings. Implement a screen that presents the product details, including an enlarged image, description, price, and any other relevant information. Add interactive elements such as buttons for adding the product to a cart or wishlist.

4. **Cart Functionality** Implement a basic cart screen that allows users to view the contents of the cart. Consider how you will manage the state of the cart across different screens and ensure that the cart information persists as users navigate through the app.

Initialise your project inside this repository as `app/my-app`, you will be making changes continuously to this folder throughout this track. Make sure to setup the `.gitignore` properly to not include build files
